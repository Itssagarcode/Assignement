            My design process typically involves four key phases: research,
            design, prototype, and test. In the research phase, I gather
            insights about the user and their needs. In the design phase, I
            create wireframes and visual designs that meet those needs. In the
            prototype phase, I create interactive models of the design for
            testing. In the test phase, I collect feedback from users to refine
            the design.
